1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
#The histogram shows that the average rating is around 3.25, and is similar to a bell shape. There is an outlier between 4.5 and 5, and most ratings of the cocoa are between 2.5 and 4. The graph is also left swkewed.
```

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar
```{r}
plot(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct)
#The graph doesn't show a correlation so the Cocoa percentage does not depend on the Rating of the Cocoa. 
```
