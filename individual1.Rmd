1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```


The graph shows that the ratings are slightly left skewed, centered around a rating of about 3.25. There is an outlier at 5 and a few outliers around 1. 

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar?
```{r}
plot(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```


No, there is no correlation between cocolate rating and cocoa percentage.
